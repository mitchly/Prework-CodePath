## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My overall unfamiliarity with Swift was the biggest challenge to overcome while building the app, but I managed to overcome these challenges. I found the prework very intriguing and I hope to continue to make more apps in the future.
